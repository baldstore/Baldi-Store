    <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px; font-size: 150%;" class="md-typescale-body-large"><b>Welcome to Baldi's Basics in Education and Learning!</b></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;" class="md-typescale-body-large">Baldi's Basics Classic Remastered is a survival horror stealth game that parodies cheap 90's edutainment and never takes itself too seriously. Explore Baldi's schoolhouse and try to find all 7 notebooks, but don't get caught by Baldi! He wants to play hide-and-seek, but something... Isn't right. Luckily you have a slew of items you can find and use to your advantage, but Baldi also has friends who can cause problems for you if you're not careful. And remember, Baldi hears every noise you make, so do what you can to stay quiet!</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px; font-size: 150%;" class="md-typescale-body-large"><b>This is the ultimate version of Baldi's Basics Classic!</b></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;" class="md-typescale-body-large">Escape Baldi's schoolhouse again in this new remastered version of Baldi's Basics Classic! Featuring three games in one, gameplay improvements, a more authentic art style, accessibility improvements, and brand new ways to play! Whether you've played the original or this is your first time, you'll surely have a blast!</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px; font-size: 150%;" class="md-typescale-body-large"><b>Featuring three games in one!</b></p>
    <p style="margin-left: 25px; margin-right: 25px;" class="md-typescale-body-large">You can experience the original game by playing in Classic Style, or you can try Baldi's Basics Birthday Bash, which wraps all the items up and shuffles them around, by playing in Party Style. Anyone who hasn’t played Baldi’s Basics Plus yet can get a taste of some of that game’s features with the new Demo Style, which mixes many of the new elements found in Baldi’s Basics Plus into the classic map! All three styles can also be played in endless mode too, where you can try to collect as many notebooks as possible before getting caught by Baldi!</p>
